# Ocarina_Quest
Class Project for Code Louisville C# 2019

This is my project for the C# course at Code Louisville. It is incredibly loosely based on the songs from the super popular Nintendo 64 game, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. A player will start by selecting to create a new player for the game, or continue and exsisting character if one is available. It isn't too fancy at the moment, just make you a character and learn some songs!
NOTE: When learning a song, the title of the song only must be typed in and spelled correctly
Next you will be able to list the available songs that the character has learned and learn new ones!
This still needs quite a bit of work but functions for the time being. Below is a list of the items I wish to complete in the near future but have yet to find time to complete.
In the mean time, feel free to enjoy learning songs!

To Do:
1) Enhance song learning to an index system, and them finaly to be prompted to input song notes like the real game
2) Make midi files available of the actual music from the game to play along during the song leaning process or play once the song has been learned
3) Increase the available storage of previous characters to 3, and then finally to a reasonable maximum of something like 20
4) Search for and view other players characters option
5) Main screen logo
6) Possible input a menu to toggle through with directional arrows in order to select and option
